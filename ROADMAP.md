## Development Approach

The development will follow these principles:

1. **User-Centered Design**: Each feature will be developed with a focus on user experience and workflow efficiency
2. **Iterative Development**: Features will be developed incrementally with regular user feedback
3. **Performance Optimization**: Continuous focus on application performance and responsiveness
4. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing with both automated tests and user acceptance testing
5. **Documentation**: Thorough documentation for both users and developers
6. **Test-Driven Development**: Critical components will be developed using TDD principles
