# Kanban Board User Guide

## Introduction

The Kanban Board is a powerful visual task management tool in TODOist that helps you organize and track your tasks through different stages of completion. This guide will walk you through how to use the Kanban Board to effectively manage your workflow.

## Accessing the Kanban Board

1. Open the TODOist application
2. Navigate to the Dashboard using the main navigation menu

## Understanding the Kanban Board

The Kanban Board is organized into columns, each representing a stage in your workflow:

- **To Do**: Tasks that haven't been started yet
- **In Progress**: Tasks that are currently being worked on
- **Review**: Tasks that are being reviewed or are blocked
- **Done**: Tasks that have been completed

Each task is represented by a card containing key information such as:
- Task title
- Priority level (with color coding)
- Due date
- Assigned team member

## Basic Usage

### Viewing Tasks

- Tasks are automatically organized into columns based on their status
- Each column shows a count of how many tasks it contains
- Completed tasks are shown with a strikethrough to differentiate them

### Moving Tasks Between Columns

1. Click and hold on a task card
2. Drag the card to the desired column
3. Release to drop the task in its new status
4. The task's status will automatically update to match its new column

### Viewing Task Details

1. Click the eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è) on any task card
2. A detailed dialog will open showing:
   - Task title and description
   - Status and priority
   - Assignment information
   - Due date
   - Tags associated with the task
3. Click "Close" to return to the board

## Advanced Features

### Filtering Tasks

You can filter tasks to focus on specific subsets:

1. Click the "Filter" button at the top of the board
2. Select from the following filter options:
   - **Assignee**: Filter tasks assigned to specific team members
   - **Priority**: Filter tasks by priority level (high, medium, low)
   - **Due Date**: Filter tasks due today, tomorrow, or overdue
3. Applied filters are shown with a badge counter
4. To clear all filters, select "Clear All Filters" from the menu

You can customize the board to match your team's workflow:

#### Adding a New Column

2. Enter a title for the new column
3. (Optional) Select a color for the column

2. Select "Delete Column" from the menu
3. The column will be removed, and its tasks will be moved to an adjacent column

### Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits

WIP limits help prevent overloading any stage of your workflow:

- When a column reaches its WIP limit, you'll see a warning message
- You cannot drag more tasks into a column that has reached its WIP limit
- Adjust WIP limits by editing the column properties

## Best Practices

### Effective Kanban Workflow

1. **Limit Work-in-Progress**: Set reasonable WIP limits to focus on completing tasks before starting new ones
2. **Regular Updates**: Move tasks to their appropriate columns as their status changes
3. **Quick Scanning**: Use column colors and task priority indicators for quick visual scanning
4. **Filter for Focus**: Use filters when working on specific projects or priorities
5. **Team Coordination**: Use the board during team meetings to discuss workflow and address bottlenecks

### Keyboard Shortcuts

For efficient board navigation:

- **Tab**: Navigate between interactive elements
- **Space/Enter**: Select or activate buttons and cards
- **Escape**: Close open dialogs or menus

## Troubleshooting
