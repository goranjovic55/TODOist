# TODOist Project Plan

## Project Overview
TODOist is a comprehensive task management desktop application designed to help users organize tasks hierarchically with rich content capabilities and external integrations. The application allows users to manage projects, groups, tasks, and steps with detailed tracking and communication features.

## Goals and Objectives
1. Create an intuitive, hierarchical task management system
2. Enable rich content attachment to tasks for comprehensive documentation
3. Implement schedule tracking with notification capabilities
4. Integrate with Microsoft To-Do and Google Tasks
5. Facilitate task-related communication for improved accountability

## Target Audience
- Individual users seeking improved organization
- Small to medium-sized teams collaborating on projects
- Professionals managing complex workflows with dependencies
- Any user requiring hierarchical task organization with content attachments

## Key Features
1. Hierarchical treeview organization
2. Drag-and-drop task management
3. Rich content attachment system
4. Schedule tracking and notifications
5. Microsoft To-Do and Google Tasks integration
6. Automated communications for delayed tasks

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Electron.js with React and TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux for application state
- **UI Components**: Material-UI
- **Data Visualization**: Simple timeline components

### Backend/Local Storage
- **Database**: IndexedDB for local storage
- **Data Synchronization**: Firebase for cloud storage (future)
- **API Communication**: Axios for external API calls
- **File Handling**: Native Electron APIs

### Integration Points
- Microsoft To-Do API
- Google Tasks API

## Development Approach
- **Development Methodology**: Agile with 2-week sprints
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub
- **Testing Strategy**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Core task management capabilities
- File attachment functionality
- External service integration (Microsoft, Google)
- Automated testing infrastructure

### Out of Scope (Future Considerations)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Integration API changes | Medium | High | Implement adapter pattern, regular API monitoring |
| Performance issues with large datasets | Medium | Medium | Implement pagination, virtual scrolling, data chunking |
| User adoption barriers | Medium | High | Focus on intuitive UX, comprehensive onboarding |
| Data loss concerns | Low | High | Implement robust backup, sync, and recovery systems |

## Success Criteria
1. Application successfully manages 1000+ tasks without performance degradation
2. External integrations function reliably with 98%+ uptime
3. User interface receives positive feedback in usability testing
4. Automated test suite achieves 90%+ code coverage
5. Application passes all specified workflow tests
