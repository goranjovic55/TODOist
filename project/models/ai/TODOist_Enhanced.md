# TODOist: Enhanced Task Management Application

## Core Concept
A comprehensive task management application with hierarchical organization, rich content capabilities, and multiple export/integration options.

## UI Components

### Primary Interface

  - Drag and drop functionality for easy reorganization
  - Color-coding for task status and priority
  - Collapsible/expandable groups and subgroups
  - Context menu for quick actions
  - Search and filter capabilities

- **Right Panel**: Task details with tabbed interface
  - **Overview Tab**: Basic information and quick edit
  - **Details Tab**: Comprehensive task information
    - Description field with rich text formatting
    - Start and end dates with time selection
    - Priority selector
    - Status dropdown (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)
    - Tags for additional categorization
  - **Attachments Tab**: File and document management
    - Document preview functionality
    - Direct editing for text files
    - Version history for attachments
  - **Notes Tab**: Additional information and comments
    - Rich text editor with formatting options
    - @mentions for team collaboration
    - Timestamps for tracking discussion history

- **Bottom Panel**: Schedule and timeline
  - Simple timeline view for deadline tracking
  - Calendar integration for scheduling
  - Progress tracking with completion indicators

## Data Organization
1. **Projects**: Top-level organization (e.g., "Home Renovation")
2. **Groups**: Categorical divisions within projects (e.g., "Kitchen")
3. **Tasks**: Actionable items (e.g., "Install Cabinets")
4. **Steps**: Individual components of tasks (e.g., "Purchase materials")

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Task Hierarchy Management**: Create, edit, delete, and organize tasks
- **Drag and Drop Interface**: Intuitive reorganization of tasks
- **Rich Content Support**: Attach files, images, links, and formatted text
- **Date Management**: Start/end dates, reminders, recurring tasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Status updates, completion percentages
- **Search and Filter**: Find tasks by various criteria

### Import/Export Capabilities
- **File Formats**:
  - JSON for full data preservation
  - CSV for spreadsheet compatibility
  - PDF for reporting and sharing
  - Markdown for simple text-based formats
  - XLSX for Excel integration

- **Integration Options**:
  - Microsoft To-Do synchronization
    - Two-way sync of tasks and deadlines
    - Status updates reflected in both systems
    - Attachment links shared between platforms
  - Google Tasks integration
    - Bidirectional task synchronization
    - Calendar event integration
    - Reminder consolidation across platforms

### Collaboration Features
- **Sharing Options**: Share tasks or projects with specific permissions
- **Comment System**: Discuss tasks within the application
- **Assignment**: Assign tasks to team members
- **Notifications**: Alert users about deadlines, changes, or mentions
- **Automated Communications**: Send emails or notifications to responsible persons when tasks are behind schedule
- **Contact Options**: Direct messaging, email integration, and notification preferences for task owners
- **Escalation Workflows**: Define escalation paths for severely delayed tasks with automatic notifications to supervisors

### Task Monitoring
- **Schedule Tracking**: Automatic detection of tasks that have passed deadlines or are at risk
- **Responsible Person Alerts**: Configurable notification system to alert task owners about schedule slippage
- **Communication Templates**: Pre-defined email and message templates for different types of schedule violations
- **Read Receipts**: Confirmation tracking for communications about delayed tasks
- **Follow-up Reminders**: Automatic follow-up notifications if no action is taken after initial alerts

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API development
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible data storage
- **State Management**: Redux for predictable state handling
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI for consistent design

### Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: IndexedDB for offline capability
- **Cloud Sync**: Firebase for real-time synchronization
- **Backup**: Automated backup system to prevent data loss

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Load task details on demand
- **Pagination**: Limit large datasets in views
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data locally
- **Background Sync**: Update data without interrupting the user

### Extensibility
- **Plugin System**: Allow custom extensions
- **API Access**: Enable third-party integrations
- **Webhooks**: Trigger external actions based on task events
- **Custom Fields**: User-defined task properties

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Desktop)
- Basic treeview implementation

- Schedule tracking and notifications
- Primary integrations (Microsoft To-Do and Google Tasks)

### Phase 3: Collaboration and Extensions (Desktop)
- User accounts and sharing
- Team collaboration features
- Additional integrations
- Communication system for out-of-schedule tasks

### Phase 4: Refinement and Testing (Desktop)
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing
  - Automated unit and integration tests
  - End-to-end workflow simulations
  - User scenario testing
  - Stress testing for large data sets
- Automated workflow testing
  - Simulation of complete user workflows
  - Capture of performance metrics during workflows
  - Edge case detection and handling
  - Regression testing framework
- Debugging infrastructure
  - Detailed logging system
  - Error reporting and analytics
